💡 Loan Default Risk Analysis (Power BI, SQL & Excel)

End-to-end Loan Default Risk Analysis using SQL, Excel (DAX), and Power BI for actionable financial insights and risk evaluation.

🚀 Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed loan applicants’ demographic and financial data to uncover key risk indicators that contribute to loan defaults.
The goal was to transform raw loan data into clear visual insights that help financial institutions minimize default rates and enhance lending decisions.

🎯 Goal	Methodology	💰 Impact
Identify high-risk applicants	SQL → Excel (DAX) → Power BI	Improved loan risk visibility and decision accuracy
🛠️ Technology Stack & Skills
Tool / Technology	Skill Highlight
SQL (SQLQueryLoan.sql)	Data cleaning, aggregation, and risk grouping
Excel (DAX Formulas)	Financial KPIs and metric calculations
Power BI (Loan Risk and Applicant Analysis Template.pbit)	Dashboard creation & data storytelling
GitHub	Version control and project documentation
📈 Key Insights & Findings

Default Rate: Certain borrower segments showed higher default probability

Demographics: Younger age groups and lower-income applicants had greater default risk

Financial Metrics: High Debt-to-Income and Loan-to-Value ratios were key risk indicators

Business Outcome: Helped improve credit decision accuracy and financial forecasting
